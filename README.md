Pepperminty Wiki is a complete wiki engine contained in a single file, inspired by @am2064's [Minty Wiki](https://github.com/am2064/Minty-Wiki). It's open source too (under MPL-2.0), so contributions are welcome!

Developed by Starbeamrainbowlabs (though contributions from others are welcome!), Pepperminty Wiki has a variety of useful (and cool!) features - such as file upload, a dynamic help page, page revision history, page tags, and more! Other amazing features are in the works too (like a theme gallery, auto update, and user watchlists), so check the release notes to see what's been added recently.

**Latest Version:** v0.17.1 (stable) v0.18-dev (development) ([Changelog](https://github.com/sbrl/Pepperminty-Wiki/blob/master/Changelog.md))

## Todo
Here's a list of things that I want to add at some point (please feel free to [send a pull request](https://github.com/sbrl/Pepperminty-Wiki/pulls) and help out!).

 - Better page history (revert to revision, compare revisions, etc.) (#78, #79)
 - Intelligent auto-updating system that doesn't wipe your settings / module choices
 - A module registry of some sort (ideas welcome!)
 - Image maps (#103)
 - An app for Android (Sorry, iOS is not practical at the current time. Feel free to make one yourself! I'm happy to help out if you need help with Pepperminty Wiki itself (e.g. making it more machine-readable (#138)) - message on Gitter (see above), or open an issue on this repository.) - in progress over [here](https://github.com/sbrl/Pepperminty-Wiki-Client-Android/)!
 - User watchlists
 - Theme gallery (#5)
 - (See more on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/sbrl/Pepperminty-Wiki/issues)!)
 - ...?
